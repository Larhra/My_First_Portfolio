        <h3>Aleph Zero</h3> 
        <p>Aleph Zero is a layer 1 blockchain with a highly-scalable architecture, which has its own AlephBFT consensus mechanism. In addition to WASM, 
            the networks EVM-powered Layer 2 brings compatibility with Ethereum and enables Solidity developers to integrate their applications easily. 
            They also benefit from Aleph Zero's privacy features, which form zkOS, a unique and universal privacy system for crypto and AI, 
            as well as the use cases that follow, such as DeFi, RWA, and data storage. </p>
